INTRODUCTION                                             *notmuch-introduction*

Notmuch is a command line program that indexes your local mail from a Maildir
structure into a database wherein each message or thread can be tagged,
searched, and manipulated in flexible and powerful ways. To learn more about
the email program, check out their website:

    `Notmuch`: https://notmuchmail.org

Notmuch.nvim interfaces the notmuch mail indexer to provide a convenient mail
reader as a NeoVim plugin. The main goal of Notmuch.nvim is to bring closer
the workflow of reading mail and editing text. In a sense, this plugin acts as
a front-end for notmuch's command line interface.

Note: This plugin is written almost entirely in Lua, and hence requires NeoVim
version 0.5 to make use of the embedded LuaJIT compiler.

FEATURE OVERVIEW                                             *notmuch-features*

The Notmuch plugin ships with two main vim commands. These can be extended
using your own commands, functions, or mappings.

The first command, |:Notmuch| , serves as an entry point into notmuch by
displaying a list of all available tags in your database. The second command,
|:NmSearch| , performs a query on your notmuch database using given arguments
and returns a list of matched threads. These commands are explained in more
depth in section ...

Here is a non-comprehensive list of features of notmuch.nvim:

- Browse your email(s)
  - Traverse through threads with familiar Vim movements
  - Manipulate text with visual selections and registers
- Read threads in thread view
  - Each message in the thread is loaded into buffer
  - Folding enabled for each message
  - Messages indented based on reply level
- Inspect the attachments of messages
  - Save to current directory
  - View attachment with `open(1)`-like command
  - Plain text message is automatically displayed
- Sync your mail with simple mappings
  - Native support for `isync(1)`/`mbsync(1)`
  - Sync command can be extended and modified
- Search your notmuch database asynchronously
  - Non-blocking: do your thing while results pour in
  - Any search term accepted by `notmuch-search-terms(1)`
    - Completion provided with the `:NmSearch` command
  - Returns a list of threads
- Tagging threads/messages
  - Add, remove, or toggle one or more tags at once
  - Inspect all tags pertinent to thread/msg
- GitHub compatibility features
  - Follow pull request patches
- Extract URLs with a script

REQUIREMENTS                                             *notmuch-requirements*

The following is a list of specific requirements for running Notmuch.nvim. The
plugin depends on bare minimum requirements in terms of installation and
doesn't depend on any external plugins.

NeoVim version~

  Notmuch.nvim requires NeoVim (>=0.5) to make use of its embedded LuaJIT
  compiler, since the plugin is written mostly in Lua.

  If your operating system or distribution only contains an older version, you
  can build the source code from HEAD or from the nightly branch (recommended)
  from the following GitHub page:

      `NeoVim`: https://github.com/neovim/neovim

Notmuch~

  The plugin interfaces with Notmuch and requires the executable to be
  installed, which you will probably have anyway provided that you plan to use
  the plugin to manipulate mail.

  More specifically the plugin contains bindings that call on functions from
  the libnotmuch library. Ensure that you have these installed.

  Both the mentioned items can be installed through your operating system's
  native package manager, or you can build it from source:

      `Notmuch`: https://notmuchmail.org
